# NMEG_FluxProc Documentation

This is the documentation for the NMEG_FluxProc code repository, which is 
primarily used to process and quality assure data from the New Mexico
Elevation Gradient. It is written in and called from MATLAB (mostly).

## Doc pages

* [Common tasks and scripts](TaskScripts.md)
* [Data releases (and corresponding git tags)](DataReleases.md)
* [Configuration](ConfigFiles.md) and [Header Resolution](HeaderResolution.md) - these are just placeholders for documentation that needs to be completed.
